            Lemonade is played by buying and staking Lemonade stands to
            locations around a fantasy town. The stands are represented on the
            Avalanche blockchain by NFTs.
          </p>

          <p>
            When staked, these stands produce $Lemonade, which can be bought and
            swapped on TraderJoe, just like and Ethereum and Doge, because they
            are real magic internet money (MiM) and they hold a value based on
            the same economics the govern your country&pos;s currency.
          </p>

          <p>
            Lemonade stands stats are &quot;rolled&quot; at the time of minting
            and can be <span className="text-common">Common</span>,{" "}
            <span className="text-epic">Epic</span>, or{" "}
            <span className="text-legendary">Legendary</span>! The rarity of the
            stands determine how much $Lemonade are produced, along with other
            factors like town location, upgrades, and worker fatigue.
